To run my program all you need to do is type "Python3 PlayNeuralNet.py" in the terminal. The network has already been trained so there is no need to run that file to play the program. Once you type the above command in the terminal wait a few second and then there will be a prompt asking you for a spot to put your marker on the tic tac toe board. The top row is 1-3, the second row is 4-6, and the final row is 7-9. All left to right. Type in your answer and wait for the Neural Network to make a move. You will then repeat this process till the game is over.


NNSimulation.py should not be run. It simulates 100 games and produces a grpah which can be found in my Report. 

TicTacToeGame.py also does not need to be run. It was used to simulate 10,000 games with a minimax agent. If you fo want to run it you will need to comment out the for loop. 

FinalNetwork.py is my neural network. If you wan to run it, it will show you the training process. Type python "FinalNetwork.py" to run it.

My data sets can be found in "MiniMaxMove.txt" and "boardLayouts.txt"

Enjoy!
